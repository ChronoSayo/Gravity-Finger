## Insights
Mobile devices are the future, which is why I decided to have at least one mobile game in my repertoire. I decided to make a game which is easy to play and make use of the modern smartphone devices. It had to remain simple enough in game design to make it obvious on how to play for the player without needing a tutorial. The levels introduce new dynamics, which are then expanded upon.
